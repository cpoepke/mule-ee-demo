Using Mule EE license in Unit Tests
============

To Unit Test with Mule EE, you need the Mule EE license in your classpath. By adding it into this jar and adding it as
a dependency, it is found by the embedded Mule automatically. The muleLicenseKey.lic is created when you import your
license key into your mule stand alone server in the conf folder. Consult the Mule EE documentation on importing the
license key.
